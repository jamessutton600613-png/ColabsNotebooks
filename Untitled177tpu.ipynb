        "*   The Cautious strategy population rapidly declined to zero by step 1000 and remained extinct throughout the simulation.\n",
        "*   The Reckless strategy population dominated throughout the simulation, although its count fluctuated.\n",
        "*   All three protoribosome states (Active, Arrested, and Inactive) were present throughout the simulation, with their counts fluctuating over time.\n",
        "*   The average RNA damage across the population fluctuated significantly over the simulation steps.\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The simulation parameters strongly favored the Reckless strategy, leading to the extinction of the Cautious strategy. Future simulations could explore different parameter sets (e.g., damage rates, repair rates, replication costs) to see if they allow for coexistence or favor the Cautious strategy.\n",
        "*   The fluctuations in protoribosome states and average RNA damage suggest a dynamic interaction with the simulated environmental cycles. Further analysis could correlate these fluctuations directly with the changing temperature and UV levels to understand their impact on agent physiology and population dynamics.\n"
