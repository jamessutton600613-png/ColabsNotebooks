# Phase 3 — Quantum Memory Extensions (300–310)

New notebooks (300–310) pending sorting into three technical threads:

- **AFC / cavity quantum memory** (bandwidth, cavity response, ridge drift)
- **FAD / ordering** (chemistry-side ordering simulations where relevant)
- **Operational nonlocality / admissibility** (channel-level deviation metrics)

These notebooks are working research artefacts; papers/DOIs in the Programme Index remain the canonical reference.
