# Phase 3 — Quantum Memory / AFC / Operational Extensions (Notebooks 300–310)

This directory contains working research notebooks that directly supported:

- GQR-43 (AFC1) — Regime-resolved bandwidth robustness  
- GQR-44 (AFC2) — Ridge-drift tolerance law  
- GQR-45 (AFC3) — Geometry–Coherence coupling  
- GQR-46 (AFC4) — Admissibility architecture / control envelope  
- GQR-47 — Operational channel admissibility and nonlocal deviation  
- GC_arc12 — Governed diversification / adaptive computation controller

These notebooks are **figure-generation, parameter sweep, and Monte Carlo evidence-pack engines** underlying those papers.

## Status

These notebooks are:

- Reproducible computational artefacts
- Raw research engines
- Not publication-polished

The canonical paper sequence is defined in the Programme Index of the GQR repository.

This folder represents the computational substrate for Phase 3 of the programme.
