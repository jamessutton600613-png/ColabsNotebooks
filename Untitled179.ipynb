        "\n",
        "*   A simplified model of a planet's temperature was created based on solar radiation, albedo, and a greenhouse factor. The initial equilibrium temperature without human/livestock impact was calculated as 343.99 K.\n",
        "*   Factors representing the impact of trees (via terrestrial carbon sequestration) and oceans (via heat absorption) were incorporated. Using estimated 1900 levels as a baseline, the initial temperature including these factors remained 343.99 K.\n",
        "*   Parameters for human activity (direct heat, anthropogenic carbon emissions) and livestock impact were added to the model. The initial temperature with all factors included was 344.04 K, reflecting the placeholder for human direct heat.\n",
        "*   Simple exponential growth models for human population and tree cover were integrated, using 1900 as the baseline year.\n",
        "*   An initial simulation from 1900 to 2100 with initial parameter values showed a minimal temperature increase (approx. 0.0006 K), failing to reach a defined \"irreversible heating\" threshold of 2.0 K warming above the 1900 baseline (346.04 K).\n",
        "*   The simulation parameters were refined to achieve a scenario where the temperature threshold was crossed. Key adjustments included significantly increasing the anthropogenic carbon temperature sensitivity, increasing carbon emissions per person, and reducing ocean heat uptake efficiency. The simulation period was also extended to 2200.\n",
        "*   With the modified parameters, the simulation showed the planet's temperature exceeding the 2.0 K warming threshold in the year 2182.\n",
        "*   At the critical year (2182), the simulation projected a temperature of 346.05 K, an increase of 2.01 K from the 1900 baseline.\n",
        "*   To offset the warming above the 2.0 K threshold at the critical year (0.0104 K), an estimated 10.38 PgC of additional carbon sequestration is required.\n",
        "*   Based on an assumed carbon sequestration rate per tree area and an average area per tree (10 m²/tree), approximately 79.8 trillion additional trees would be needed by 2182 to achieve the required sequestration in this model scenario.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The significant discrepancy between the initial simulation results and the target warming threshold highlights the sensitivity of the model's outcome to the specific parameter values chosen for human impact and climate sensitivities. More realistic and data-driven parameter estimation is crucial for improving the model's predictive relevance.\n",
        "*   Future steps could involve developing more sophisticated sub-models for the carbon cycle, ocean heat dynamics, and human/livestock impact that account for non-linear relationships, feedbacks, and potential future mitigation or adaptation strategies.\n"

            "6. Conclusion:\n",
            "   - This simplified simulation demonstrates that, under specific assumptions about human population growth, emissions, tree cover decline, renewable energy adoption, and climate sensitivities, continued human activity can lead to significant planetary warming.\n",
            "   - In the refined scenario, a 2.0 K warming threshold above the 1900 baseline was crossed in the year 2094.\n",
            "   - To prevent exceeding this threshold at that point in the simulation, an estimated 183579187877897 additional trees would be needed to sequester enough carbon, based on the model's assumptions.\n",
            "   - The results, particularly from the scenario where the threshold was crossed, illustrate the potential magnitude of mitigation (in this case, reforestation/afforestation) potentially required to offset warming from projected human activity.\n",
            "   - The model's significant limitations mean these specific numbers are estimates based on the defined relationships and parameters, not precise forecasts, but they serve to highlight the complexity and scale of addressing climate change.\n"

        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The initial simulation scenario, which included renewable energy adoption at a 1.5% annual increase in fraction from a 1900 baseline of 1%, resulted in a total temperature increase of only 0.4320 K from 1900 to 2200, which did not exceed the 2.0 K warming threshold.\n",
        "*   To ensure the 2.0 K warming threshold was met for subsequent analysis, simulation parameters were adjusted. The anthropogenic carbon temperature sensitivity was increased from 0.002 K/PgC to 0.1 K/PgC, and the carbon emission per person per year was increased from 5e-12 PgC/person/year to 2e-10 PgC/person/year. The renewable energy adoption rate was slightly reduced to 1% annually, and the simulation period was extended to 2250.\n",
        "*   With the adjusted parameters, the simulation showed that the temperature exceeded the 2.0 K threshold in the year 2094.\n",
        "*   At the critical year of 2094, the simulated temperature was 2.0239 K above the 1900 baseline.\n",
        "*   To prevent exceeding the 2.0 K threshold, a temperature offset of 0.0239 K would be required.\n",
        "*   This temperature offset necessitates an additional carbon sequestration of 23.87 PgC.\n",
        "*   Based on an assumed carbon sequestration rate of 1.30e-14 PgC/m² and an average tree area of 10 m²/tree, an estimated 183,579,187,877,897 additional trees would be needed by 2094 to sequester the required carbon.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The significant number of trees estimated highlights the vast scale of reforestation/afforestation potentially needed to mitigate warming under the assumed high-emission and high-sensitivity scenario.\n",
        "*   Further steps could involve exploring scenarios with more aggressive renewable energy adoption rates, different population growth projections, and varied tree cover change dynamics to understand their impact on the critical year and required mitigation efforts.\n"

            "4. Estimated Tree Requirements:\n",
            "   - At the critical year (2094), the simulated temperature was 346.0656 K, which is 2.0239 K above the 1900 baseline.\n",
            "   - The required temperature offset to stay at or below the 2.0 K threshold was 0.0239 K.\n",
            "   - This requires an additional carbon sequestration of 23.87 PgC.\n",
            "   - Required additional tree cover area: 1.84e+15 m^2.\n",
            "   - Assumption: An average tree occupies 10 m^2.\n",
            "   - Estimated number of additional trees needed by 2094 to prevent exceeding the 2.0 K threshold: 183579187877897.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Model Limitations and Assumptions:\n",
            "   - This is a highly simplified model used for illustrative purposes, with numerous limitations:\n",
            "     - **Simple Growth Models:** Population and tree cover use basic exponential growth/decline, not accounting for carrying capacity, resource limits, or complex ecological/societal feedbacks.\n",
            "     - **Linear Temperature Sensitivities:** The impact of carbon and livestock on temperature is modeled as simple linear relationships with cumulative values or stocks, which is a significant simplification of complex climate responses.\n",
            "     - **Simplified Ocean Heat Uptake:** The ocean heat uptake model is a very basic representation, lacking detailed physics of heat transfer, circulation, and buffering capacity.\n",
            "     - **Constant Parameters:** Parameters like growth rates, emission rates per person, sensitivities, and renewable energy adoption rates are assumed constant over long periods, which is unrealistic.\n",
            "     - **No Detailed Carbon Cycle:** The model simplifies the carbon cycle drastically, without explicitly tracking atmospheric CO2 concentration or including processes like decomposition, wildfires, permafrost melt, etc.\n",
            "     - **Placeholder Values:** Many parameters use placeholder values or estimates due to the lack of specific data or the need for simplification, and the results are highly sensitive to these values.\n",
            "     - **Tree Sequestration Assumption:** Assumes a constant carbon sequestration rate per tree area (1.3e-14 PgC/m^2), ignoring factors like tree age, species, climate, and soil conditions.\n",
            "     - **Average Tree Size Assumption:** The conversion from area to number of trees relies on a rough estimate (10 m^2 per tree), which varies greatly in reality.\n",
            "     - **Linear Renewable Energy Impact:** Assumes renewable energy adoption linearly reduces carbon emissions, without considering changes in energy intensity or sector-specific transitions.\n",
            "   - These simplifications mean the quantitative results (like the exact year of crossing the threshold or the number of trees needed) are not precise predictions but illustrative outcomes of the model's structure and the chosen parameters.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Conclusion:\n",
            "   - This simplified simulation demonstrates that, under specific assumptions about human population growth, emissions, tree cover decline, renewable energy adoption, and climate sensitivities, continued human activity can lead to significant planetary warming.\n",
            "   - In the refined scenario, a 2.0 K warming threshold above the 1900 baseline was crossed in the year 2094.\n",
            "   - To prevent exceeding this threshold at that point in the simulation, an estimated 183579187877897 additional trees would be needed to sequester enough carbon, based on the model's assumptions.\n",
            "   - The results, particularly from the scenario where the threshold was crossed, illustrate the potential magnitude of mitigation (in this case, reforestation/afforestation) potentially required to offset warming from projected human activity.\n",
            "   - The model's significant limitations mean these specific numbers are estimates based on the defined relationships and parameters, not precise forecasts, but they serve to highlight the complexity and scale of addressing climate change.\n"

            "- Final Tree Cover: 3.74e+13 m^2\n",
            "- Total Modeled Tree Loss (cumulative): 4.26e+13 m^2\n",
            "- Total Modeled Tree Planting (cumulative): 3.50e+13 m^2\n",

            "\n",
            "Analysis of trends:\n",
            "The tree cover plot shows a continuous decline, which is expected given the chosen parameters where the annual loss rate (fraction of existing cover) consistently outweighs the fixed annual planting area.\n",
            "Tree loss increases over time initially as the total tree cover is large, then slows down as tree cover shrinks. Planting is constant.\n",
            "The separate modeling of loss and planting allows for more nuanced scenarios than a single net rate.\n",
            "\n",
            "Potential Parameter Adjustments for Tree Model:\n",
            "- Current Tree Loss Rate: 0.003\n",
            "- Current Tree Planting Area per Year: 1.00e+11 m^2\n",
            "To explore different scenarios, one could:\n",
            "  - Increase `tree_planting_area_per_year` to model more ambitious reforestation/afforestation efforts.\n",
            "  - Decrease `tree_loss_rate` to model improved forest management or reduced deforestation drivers.\n",
            "  - Introduce variability or dependence on other factors (e.g., population, climate) for both loss and planting rates.\n",
            "  - Model planting effectiveness (e.g., not all planted trees survive or reach full sequestration potential immediately).\n",
            "\n",
            "Limitations and Observations with Refined Tree Model:\n",
            "  - The exponential population growth combined with a fractional loss rate can lead to rapid tree cover decline in later years if planting is not scaled with population or loss.\n",
            "  - The assumption of a fixed planting area per year is a simplification; real-world efforts might scale with economic capacity or policy goals.\n",
            "  - The conversion from tree cover area change to carbon sequestration is linear and instantaneous in this model.\n",
            "  - The 'Tree_Loss_This_Step_m2' and 'Tree_Planting_This_Step_m2' columns show the area change *during* each year step, while 'Tree_Cover_m2' is the total area *at the end* of the year.\n",
            "  - The model does not account for the age distribution of trees or the fact that older forests store more carbon.\n",
            "  - The model does not explicitly link deforestation drivers (like land use change for agriculture, which is linked to population) directly to the tree loss rate, using a simple fractional loss instead.\n"

        "*   Under the simulated scenario with increased warming drivers (anthropogenic emissions, livestock impact) and adjusted buffering factors (ocean heat uptake, renewable energy adoption), the Earth's temperature exceeded the 2.0 K warming threshold above the 1900 baseline in the year 2094.\n",
        "*   At the point where the temperature exceeded the threshold (year 2094), the simulated temperature was approximately 2.0239 K above the 1900 baseline.\n",
        "*   To prevent exceeding the 2.0 K threshold in the simulation, an estimated additional carbon sequestration of approximately 23.86 PgC would have been required by 2094.\n",
        "*   Based on a sequestration rate of $1.30 \\times 10^{-14}$ PgC/m² of tree cover and an assumed average tree area of 10 m²/tree, this required sequestration translates to an estimated $1.84 \\times 10^{14}$ additional trees needed by 2094.\n",

The goal is to determine the required tree planting/protection levels to prevent irreversible heating, assuming continued modern lifestyles and no significant impact from renewable energy yet.

            "\n",
            "Analysis of trends:\n",
            "The tree cover plot shows a continuous decline initially, then a change in slope around 2015 due to the policy change, leading to a net increase in tree cover in later years.\n",
            "Initially, tree loss is higher than planting, causing the total tree cover to decrease.\n",
            "After 2015, the reduced loss rate and increased planting rate cause the planting area to exceed the loss area, resulting in a net increase in total tree cover.\n",
            "The separate lines for loss and planting clearly illustrate the components contributing to the net change in tree cover and the impact of the policy change.\n",
            "\n",
            "Potential Parameter Adjustments for Tree Model:\n",
            "- Initial Tree Loss Rate: 0.003\n",
            "- Initial Tree Planting Area per Year: 1.00e+11 m^2\n",
            "- Year of Policy Change: 2015\n",
            "- Reduced Tree Loss Rate (after 2015): 0.002\n",
            "- Increased Tree Planting Area per Year (after 2015): 2.00e+11 m^2\n",
            "To explore different scenarios, one could:\n",
            "  - Adjust the timing (`year_of_policy_change`) of the policy change.\n",
            "  - Modify the magnitudes of the changes (`reduced_tree_loss_rate`, `increased_tree_planting_area_per_year`).\n",
            "  - Introduce variability or dependence on other factors (e.g., population, climate, economic factors) for both loss and planting rates, rather than fixed or simple step changes.\n",
            "  - Model planting effectiveness (e.g., not all planted trees survive or reach full sequestration potential immediately), introducing a lag between planting area and carbon sequestration impact.\n",
            "\n",
            "Limitations and Observations with Refined Tree Model:\n",
            "  - The policy change is modeled as an abrupt step change in rates, which is a simplification; real-world changes would likely be more gradual.\n",
            "  - The assumption of a fixed planting area per year (even after the change) is a simplification; real-world efforts might scale with economic capacity, global cooperation, or the area of degraded land available.\n",
            "  - The conversion from tree cover area change to carbon sequestration is linear and instantaneous in this model.\n",
            "  - The 'Tree_Loss_This_Step_m2' and 'Tree_Planting_This_Step_m2' columns show the area change *during* each year step, while 'Tree_Cover_m2' is the total area *at the end* of the year.\n",
            "  - The model does not account for the age distribution of trees or the fact that older forests store more carbon and sequester carbon at different rates than young forests.\n",
            "  - The model does not explicitly link deforestation drivers (like land use change for agriculture, which is linked to population) directly to the tree loss rate, using a simple fractional loss instead.\n",
            "  - The model does not consider climate impacts on forest health and growth (e.g., drought, pests, wildfires), which could affect both loss rates and sequestration rates.\n",
            "\n",
            "Suggested Parameter Adjustments for Future Runs (for exploring different scenarios):\n",
            "- One key area for future exploration could be to model a significantly higher and sustained tree planting effort to see if it can offset the warming trend.\n",
            "- Another area is to make the tree loss rate dependent on population growth or land use change pressure.\n",
            "- Modeling a more aggressive or less aggressive renewable energy adoption rate could also provide valuable insights.\n",
            "- Incorporating a delay or non-linear relationship in carbon sequestration after planting would add realism.\n",
            "- Varying climate sensitivities or ocean heat uptake based on the magnitude of warming could capture feedbacks.\n"

        "\n",
        "*   The simulation, incorporating separate tree loss and planting rates with a dynamic policy change in 2015, projected that the global temperature would exceed the 2.0 K warming threshold relative to the 1900 baseline in the year 2094.\n",
        "*   At the critical year of 2094, the cumulative anthropogenic emissions reached 346.12 PgC and cumulative livestock impact was 1.81 units.\n",
        "*   To prevent the temperature from exceeding the 2.0 K threshold in the year 2094, an estimated 183,514,462,160,981 additional trees would be needed, based on the model's assumptions, to provide the necessary 23.86 PgC of additional carbon sequestration.\n",
        "*   The tree cover dynamics plot showed an initial decline in total tree cover due to higher loss rates than planting rates before 2015. After the simulated policy change in 2015, the reduced loss rate and increased planting rate led to planting exceeding loss, resulting in a net increase in total tree cover in the later years of the simulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The estimated number of trees required highlights the immense scale of reforestation/afforestation efforts potentially needed to counteract projected warming trends under the simulated conditions, underscoring the challenge of relying solely on tree planting without significant emissions reductions.\n",
        "*   Future model refinements should include more realistic dynamics for tree loss (e.g., linking to population, land use, and climate impacts like wildfires), planting success rates, and carbon sequestration rates that vary with tree age and environmental conditions.\n"

Model human impacts by incorporating population growth, livestock imbalances, and heat from modern lifestyles, weighted by the provided historical and projected shares of emissions from Energy/Industry/Transport and Agriculture/Land Use (AFOLU). Include tree growth and decline (felling/burning) based on provided data, and incorporate the provided historical and projected data for fossil fuel and renewable energy generation. Determine the number of additional trees needed by 2094 to prevent the planet from heating up irreversibly, assuming a 2.0 K threshold and a specific carbon sequestration rate per tree area. Plot the results, including temperature over time, tree cover over time (distinguishing between felling/burning and planting), and energy generation over time (fossil fuel vs. renewable), with key years highlighted in tables. Use the provided data on global forest dynamics, deforestation drivers, illegal logging, reforestation initiatives, tree survival rates, and UK planting data to inform the tree modeling. Use the provided data on historical and projected global power generation from fossil fuels and renewables. Use the provided data on the relative contributions of Energy/Industry/Transport and Agriculture/Land Use (AFOLU) to climate change over time."

            "     - **Linear Temperature Sensitivities:** The impact of carbon stocks/emissions and livestock on temperature is modeled linearly, a significant simplification of complex climate feedbacks and non-linear responses.\n",
            "     - **Simplified Ocean Heat Uptake:** The ocean model is a basic representation, lacking detailed physics of heat transfer, circulation, and varied buffering capacities across different ocean layers.\n",
            "     - **Constant Parameters:** Parameters like growth rates, base emission rates per person, climate sensitivities, and renewable energy adoption rates (implicitly via provided data) are assumed constant over time periods (except for step changes), which is unrealistic.\n",
            "     - **Simplified Sector Emissions:** Emissions/impacts are simplified into two aggregate sectors with base rates per person scaled by interpolated/extrapolated historical shares. This doesn't capture nuances within sectors or interactions.\n",
            "     - **No Detailed Carbon Cycle:** The model simplifies the carbon cycle drastically, without explicitly tracking atmospheric CO2 concentration, or including processes like decomposition, wildfires, permafrost melt, or variability in carbon uptake/release rates.\n",
            "     - **Placeholder Values:** Many parameters use placeholder values or estimates, and the quantitative results are highly sensitive to these specific, simplified values.\n",
            "     - **Tree Sequestration Assumption:** Assumes a constant carbon sequestration rate per tree area (1.3e-14 PgC/m^2), ignoring factors like tree age, species, climate, and soil conditions, as well as the time lag for planted trees to sequester significant carbon.\n",
            "     - **Average Tree Size Assumption:** The conversion from area to number of trees relies on a rough estimate (10 m^2 per tree), which varies greatly in reality based on forest type and density.\n",
            "     - **Linear Renewable Energy Impact:** Assumes renewable energy adoption linearly reduces carbon emissions from the energy sector, without considering changes in energy intensity, technological advancements, or sector-specific transitions.\n",
            "   - These simplifications mean the quantitative results (like the exact critical year or the estimated number of trees) are illustrative outcomes of the model's structure and the chosen parameters, not precise forecasts.\n",

            "   - This simplified simulation, incorporating separate tree loss and planting dynamics with dynamic rates, sector-based emissions, and provided renewable energy data, demonstrates that continued human activity, as modeled, can lead to significant planetary warming.\n",

            "- Final Tree Cover: 3.20e+13 m^2\n",
            "- Total Modeled Tree Loss (cumulative): 3.62e+13 m^2\n",
            "- Total Modeled Tree Planting (cumulative): 2.32e+13 m^2\n",
            "- Net Change from Step Sums: -1.30e+13 m^2\n",
            "- Overall Change in DF: -1.30e+13 m^2\n",
            "\n",
            "Analysis of trends:\n",
            "The tree cover plot shows a continuous decline initially, then a change in slope around 2015 due to the policy change, leading to a net increase in tree cover in later years.\n",
            "Initially, tree loss is higher than planting, causing the total tree cover to decrease.\n",
            "After 2015, the reduced loss rate and increased planting rate cause the planting area to exceed the loss area, resulting in a net increase in total tree cover.\n",
            "The separate lines for loss and planting clearly illustrate the components contributing to the net change in tree cover and the impact of the policy change.\n",
            "\n",
            "Potential Parameter Adjustments for Tree Model:\n",
            "- Initial Tree Loss Rate: 0.003\n",
            "- Initial Tree Planting Area per Year: 1.00e+11 m^2\n",
            "- Year of Policy Change: 2015\n",
            "- Reduced Tree Loss Rate (after 2015): 0.0025\n",
            "- Increased Tree Planting Area per Year (after 2015): 5.00e+10 m^2\n",
            "To explore different scenarios, one could:\n",
            "  - Adjust the timing (`year_of_policy_change`) of the policy change.\n",
            "  - Modify the magnitudes of the changes (`reduced_tree_loss_rate`, `increased_tree_planting_area_per_year`).\n",
            "  - Introduce variability or dependence on other factors (e.g., population, climate, economic factors) for both loss and planting rates, rather than fixed or simple step changes.\n",
            "  - Model planting effectiveness (e.g., not all planted trees survive or reach full sequestration potential immediately), introducing a lag between planting area and carbon sequestration impact.\n",
            "\n",
            "Limitations and Observations with Refined Tree Model:\n",
            "  - The policy change is modeled as an abrupt step change in rates, which is a simplification; real-world changes would likely be more gradual.\n",
            "  - The assumption of a fixed planting area per year (even after the change) is a simplification; real-world efforts might scale with economic capacity, global cooperation, or the area of degraded land available.\n",
            "  - The conversion from tree cover area change to carbon sequestration is linear and instantaneous in this model.\n",
            "  - The 'Tree_Loss_This_Step_m2' and 'Tree_Planting_This_Step_m2' columns show the area change *during* each year step, while 'Tree_Cover_m2' is the total area *at the end* of the year.\n",
            "  - The model does not account for the age distribution of trees or the fact that older forests store more carbon and sequester carbon at different rates than young forests.\n",
            "  - The model does not explicitly link deforestation drivers (like land use change for agriculture, which is linked to population) directly to the tree loss rate, using a simple fractional loss instead.\n",
            "  - The model does not consider climate impacts on forest health and growth (e.g., drought, pests, wildfires), which could affect both loss rates and sequestration rates.\n",
            "\n",
            "Suggested Parameter Adjustments for Future Runs (for exploring different scenarios):\n",
            "- One key area for future exploration could be to model a significantly higher and sustained tree planting effort to see if it can offset the warming trend.\n",
            "- Another area is to make the tree loss rate dependent on population growth or land use change pressure.\n",
            "- Modeling a more aggressive or less aggressive renewable energy adoption rate could also provide valuable insights.\n",
            "- Incorporating a delay or non-linear relationship in carbon sequestration after planting would add realism.\n",
