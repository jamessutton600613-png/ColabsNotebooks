# Computational Archive — GQR / GC Programme Notebooks

This repository contains the working computational notebooks underpinning
the GQR (Geometry–Quantum Resonator), QGE (Quantum Geometry Engine),
and GC-arc (Germinal Centre Governance) research programmes.

These notebooks are archived for transparency and reproducibility.
They are not structured as polished software packages.

## Repository Structure

The notebooks fall into three broad historical phases:

### 1. Origin-of-Life Simulations (Approx. 0–200)

Early exploratory simulations investigating ordering, accessibility,
and environmental cycling prior to formalisation of the GQR framework.

These simulations informed conceptual development but did not directly
generate published figures.

---

### 2. Programme-Building Notebooks (Approx. 200–300)

These notebooks generated figures, simulations, and numerical outputs
for papers listed in the canonical Programme Index:

- GQR series
- GC-arc series
- AFC (Atomic Frequency Comb) quantum memory papers

Where possible, figure numbers in publications correspond to code
sections within these notebooks.

### 3. Experimental / Scratch / GPU Workflows

Includes:

- Numerical testing
- Parameter sweeps
- GPU experiments
- Preliminary or incomplete simulations

These are retained for transparency but may contain exploratory artefacts.

---

## Important Notes

- These notebooks represent working research artefacts.
- Minor inconsistencies, redundant cells, or exploratory remnants may exist.
- Published papers (Zenodo DOIs) should be treated as the authoritative source.
- The notebooks are provided for methodological transparency rather than
  turnkey reproducibility.
