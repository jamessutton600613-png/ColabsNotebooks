# Computational Archive — GQR / QGE / GC-arc Notebooks

This repository is an archival home for **working Colab/Jupyter notebooks** used during development of the
GQR (Gated Quantum Resonator), QGE (Quantum Geometry Engine), and GC-arc programmes.

These notebooks are retained for transparency and reproducibility.  
They are **not packaged software** and may contain exploratory cells, redundant code, or partially cleaned runs.

For the canonical paper ordering and conceptual dependency chain, see:

- Programme Index (GQR): https://github.com/jamessutton600613-png/GQR/blob/main/Programme_Index.md

## Directory structure

### `00-182_OriginOfLife/`
Early exploratory simulations (origin-of-life / ordering / cycling).  
These notebooks informed concept development but **did not necessarily generate published figures**.

### `183-299_Programme/`
Programme-building notebooks that generated results, figures, or numerical sweeps for the main GQR / GC programme index
(including AOI/QGE transport work and associated figure pipelines).

### `Phase3_QuantumMemory_300plus/`
Phase 3 notebooks (300–310+) supporting the **AFC quantum memory** series and **operational admissibility / nonlocal deviation**
work (and associated control-layer evidence packs).

This folder has its own README mapping notebooks to the relevant papers.

### `Misc_Unnumbered/`
Scratch notebooks, variants, GPU/TPU tests, and unclassified artefacts retained for completeness.

## Notes on reproducibility

- Notebooks are **research artefacts**: some runs may rely on local file uploads (CSV/NPZ), Colab session state,
  or manual figure export steps.
- Published preprints (Zenodo DOIs) are the authoritative record of the results and interpretations.
- Where possible, notebooks are grouped chronologically by programme phase to preserve provenance.

## Licensing / IP

Code and notebooks are shared for academic inspection and reproducibility.  
Patent-related material exists in the broader programme; for commercial/IP enquiries, contact the author directly.
