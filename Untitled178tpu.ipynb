        "#    - Temperature: Could affect reaction rates (damage, repair) or metabolic costs. Could also vary daily and seasonally. Represented by an environmental variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. RNA Damage and Repair:\n",
        "#    - Damage Application: In each step, apply damage to each base in the 'rna_sequence'. The amount of damage applied per base is influenced by the current UV radiation level. This updates the 'rna_damage' array.\n",
        "#    - Repair Mechanism: Agents might have a repair rate. In each step, damage could be reduced on each base based on the repair rate. The repair rate could potentially be influenced by strategy or temperature. This also updates the 'rna_damage' array, reducing values towards zero.\n",

Reproduction creates a new agent with a potentially mutated RNA sequence.\n",

The 'status' field is set to 0 for dead agents. Dead agents are removed from active consideration but might be kept in the state for analysis.\n",

        "The error `Error saving initial state: name 'population_state' is not defined` and similar errors during checkpointing indicate that while `population_state` was intended to be globally available from the first cell, it's not correctly accessible when the checkpoint loading logic and simulation loop are executed. To fix this, I need to explicitly ensure that `population_state` is defined and available within this code block, either by re-initializing it if no checkpoints are loaded, or by relying on it being loaded from a checkpoint. Since the goal is to have resume functionality, I'll adjust the logic to load from a checkpoint first, and *only* if no checkpoints are found, then initialize `population_state` with the initial values (which are assumed to be available from the first cell). This will ensure `population_state` is always defined before attempting to save it.\n",
